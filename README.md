## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fjiangAI/ppt-comment-refiner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ppt-comment-refiner
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

This tool uses command-line arguments to specify input and output files as well as the OpenAI API key and other required parameters.

1. **Prepare Your PowerPoint File**: Ensure your `.pptx` file is ready for processing.

2. **Run the Refining and Dubbing Scripts**:

   ### Refining Notes
   First, use the script to extract and enhance your notes:

   ```bash
   python ppt_comment_refiner.py --pptx_path <input.pptx> --output_path <save.pptx> --api_key <api_key> --base_url <base_url>
   ```

   Replace `<input.pptx>` with the path to your original PowerPoint file, `<save.pptx>` with the path to save the refined PowerPoint file, `<api_key>` with your OpenAI API key, and `<base_url>` with the API base URL.

   ### Generate Audio from Notes and Add to PPT
   After enhancing the notes, use the `ppt_dubbing.py` script to generate audio from the refined notes and insert them into the PowerPoint slides:

   ```bash
   python ppt_dubbing.py --pptx_path <input.pptx> --output_pptx_path <output.pptx> --api_key <api_key> --base_url <base_url> --output_notes_file <notes.json> --audio_output_directory <audio_directory> --mp3_directory <audio_directory>
   ```

   Replace `<output.pptx>` with the path to save the updated presentation, and `<audio_directory>` with the directory to save the generated audio files.
